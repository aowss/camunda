== Technical Overview

=== Architecture

.Camunda Architecture
image::Camunda Architecture.png[Architecture, 430, 240, role="thumb"]

* Camunda 8 only offers a standalone deployment option, a.k.a. remote workflow engine

The clients communicate with the Zeebe cluster using https://grpc.io/[gRPC] through the gRPC Gateway.

* All the process data is streamed to an https://www.elastic.co/[Elastic Search] cluster which feeds the https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/operate/operate-introduction/[Operate], https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist/[Tasklist] and https://docs.camunda.io/optimize/components/what-is-optimize/[Optimize] components

* Zeebe uses replication and the https://raft.github.io/[RAFT protocol] for fault-tolerance

* Zeebe uses back-pressure for resilience

* Zeebe uses https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth 2] for authentication

=== Deployment

* SaaS is the preferred hosting option

The https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/console/introduction-to-console/[Console] component is used to manage the cluster.

* In the Self-Managed deployment option, Identity is the component that is in charge of authentication and authorization

It is based on https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak].

=== Modeler

* Connectors can be used from the Modeler

=== Tasklist

=== Licensing

* Every component is free for non-production use

* In the Self-Managed deployment option, the Web Modeler is available for Enterprise customers

== Best Practices

=== Development

* Use the latest https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] version: `3.2.X`
* Use the latest Java version: https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/[JDK 21]
* Use https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/spring-zeebe[Spring Zeebe] to communicate with Zeebe from Spring Boot
* The worker's client credentials should be limited to Zeebe and Tasklist

Access to Operate and Optimize is not needed for the workers.

=== Deployment

=== Modeler

* Use the https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/web-modeler/new-web-modeler/[Web Modeler] to take advantage of its collaboration features

* Use the https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/error-events/[BPMN Error event] for business errors and https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/incidents/[Camunda Incidents] for technical errors

In particular, use Camunda's built-in https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/best-practices/development/dealing-with-problems-and-exceptions/#leveraging-retries[retry mechanism].

* Follow Camunda's https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/best-practices/modeling/naming-technically-relevant-ids/#using-naming-conventions-for-bpmn-ids[best practices] regarding ID names

* Follow Camunda's https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/best-practices/modeling/naming-bpmn-elements/[best practices] regarding BPMN element names

* Use camel case for service tasks' task definition
* Use camel case for

=== Tasklist

* As mentioned in https://academy.camunda.com/c8-technical-overview[Camunda 8 - Technical Overview], we should use the Tasklist https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/tasklist-api-rest/tasklist-api-rest-overview/[REST API] over the https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/tasklist-api/tasklist-api-overview/[GraphQL API] since the latter will be deprecated soon
