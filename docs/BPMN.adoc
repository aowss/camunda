|===
||Strategic |Operational

| Target | Business | Engine
| Goal | Communicate | Execute

| Type
| Abstract:

* This is a bird's eye view of the process
* Compact, easy to read and understand
* No complicated constructs footnote:[e.g. no need to close gateways]
* Tasks are undefined
* Lanes can be used to show responsibilities

| Concrete:

* This is an executable process
* Every task is defined and bound to code if required
* No Lanes

|===

Use both type of processes: strategic first to validate understanding and then operational for execution.

== Events

* Use the https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/error-events/[BPMN Error event] for business errors

* Use None Intermediate events to model KPIs or milestones that can be tracked

* Use multiple None End events to illustrate different outcomes to help with metrics collection

* Use gateways to clarify the flow, a.k.a. explicit modeling footnote:[avoid implicit input XOR; avoid implicit output AND; use explicit OR gateway instead of conditional flow]
* Use merging gateways to make the process more readable
* Use synchronizing parallel gateways to avoid repeating tasks footnote:[or keeping the processing alive when it should be done]

* Use separate gateways for merging and splitting
